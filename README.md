Developed a Caesar cipher in Python for encrypting and decrypting messages 

Implemented functions for both encryption and decryption using a shift key 

Used “str.maketrans” and “translate” for efficient string manipulation 

Ensured case insensitivity by converting messages to lowercase 

Demonstrated the ability to handle both positive and negative shifts in the cipher
